A lo-fi adventure game created using JavaScript/jQuery, CSS, HTML. Mid-beta development(?)...it's just after the middle of Phase 1.

I've started doing daily mini-updates to supplement the most recent full file package, which will be updated weekly. If you grab the latest full update and then copy in the latest mini-update, you'll probably be fine. If things break badly, grab more mini-updates backwards through the list until it works again. Easy!

## Development Phases ##

### Phase 1 ###
Basic mechanics: start, move, collision detection, AI pathing; map selection; rudimentary combat; basic PC/NPC types; tutorial map; simple map; line-of-sight map reveal; status line output; end-of-scenario handling

### Phase 2 ###
Pickup basic objects; basic equip; map-to-map movement; save/load map state; robust scenario storyline; ranged attacks; multi-square effects

### Phase 3 ###
Campaign storyline; multi-character interactions; robust item/weapon selection; character custom equip; character levels; character types

Feel free to play with the mechanics as I build it out. The URL on this site always goes to a semi-recent version of the game; for a current view, download the latest ZIP and run index.html in whatever browser. It will be slow on old versions of IE but runs smoothly in Chrome and (usually) Firefox.
